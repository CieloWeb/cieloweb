## ⚙️ Key Principles

- **No tracking**  
  No Google Analytics, no cookies, no fingerprinting. Your usage stays on your device.

- **Client-side only**  
  Most tools work entirely in your browser — even without an internet connection.

- **No accounts required**  
  All features are available without sign-ups, logins, or social logins.

- **Offline support**  
  Many tools are installable as a PWA and work offline by design.

- **Open standards**  
  Built using modern web technologies.

## 🔐 Privacy-First Architecture

- **Hosting:** Vercel + Firebase  
- **Analytics:** Optional, zero-cookie, privacy-respecting with tools like `CieloAnalytics`  
- **Data storage:** All tools default to `localStorage` or in-browser memory  
- **No external scripts** unless explicitly needed (e.g., fetching AI via Gemini/Groq APIs)

## 📦 PWA Support

- Built with a proper `manifest.json`, icons, and offline support
- Installable as a web app on Android, iOS, and desktop
- Soon will be published to Google Play via Trusted Web Activity (TWA)
