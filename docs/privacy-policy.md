3. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve our Service. The types of information depend on your interaction with our Service.
A. Information You Provide to Us

    Account Information: When you register for an account, we collect your name, username, and email address. This is used for account management, authentication, and to sync your data.
    Communications: When you contact us via email or our contact form, we collect your name, email address, and the content of your message to respond to your inquiry.

B. Information We Collect Automatically

    Vercel Analytics: This website uses Vercel Analytics to gather privacy-friendly usage statistics. Vercel Analytics does not use cookies and does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). It helps us understand traffic sources, page views, and general user engagement to improve our website. All data is aggregated and anonymized.
    CieloAnalytics: For our own analytics service, we use a privacy-focused script that does not use cookies and hashes user information (IP address, user agent) with a daily salt to anonymously count unique visitors. This helps us measure website performance without tracking individuals.
    Cookies and Similar Technologies: We use cookies for essential functionalities and, with your consent, for advertising. For more details, please see our Cookie Policy.
    Advertising Partners: We may display ads on our Service, which may be delivered to users by advertising partners, such as Google AdSense. These partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile non-personal identification information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

C. Information from Our Tools

    Browser Extensions: Our browser extensions, including 'Fix This Page', are built with privacy-by-design. They do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. All operations are performed locally on your device.
    Client-Side Tools: Tools marked as 'Offline-First' (e.g., Password Generator, Daily Focus Planner without an account) process all data directly in your browser. No data is sent to our servers.
    Cloud-Synced Tools: For tools where you are logged in (e.g., Budget Tracker, Habit Tracker), the data you enter is encrypted in transit and stored securely in our database (Firebase) for the sole purpose of enabling cloud sync and providing the service to you. We do not access or process this tool-specific data for any other purpose.

4. Legal Basis for Processing (for GDPR)

We process your Personal Data based on the following legal grounds:

    Consent: Where you have given us explicit consent to process your data for a specific purpose (e.g., for non-essential cookies).
    Performance of a Contract: To provide the services you requested, such as managing your user account and syncing your data.
    Legitimate Interests: For purposes like improving our Service, analytics, and fraud prevention, where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
    Legal Obligation: To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

5. How We Use and Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We use your data to operate and improve our Service. We only share it in the following limited situations:

    With Service Providers: We use third-party vendors for hosting (Vercel), database management (Firebase), payment processing (Stripe), and advertising (Google). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data.
    For Legal Reasons: We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
    Business Transfers: If Firma - Fitim Ramadani (CieloWeb) is involved in a merger or acquisition, your data may be transferred as a business asset.

6. Data Retention & Security

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy. Account information is kept until you delete your account. We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit, but no system is 100% secure.
